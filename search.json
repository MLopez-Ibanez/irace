The goal in this example is to optimize instances of # the following family: #      f(x) = lambda * f_rastrigin(x) + (1 - lambda) * f_rosenbrock(x) # where lambda follows a normal distribution whose mean is 0.9 and # standard deviation is 0.02. f_rastrigin and f_rosenbrock are the # well-known Rastrigin and Rosenbrock benchmark functions (taken from # the cmaes package). In this scenario, different instances are given # by different values of lambda. ####################################################################### ## First we provide an implementation of the functions to be optimized: f_rosenbrock <- function (x) {   d <- length(x)   z <- x + 1   hz <- z[1L:(d - 1L)]   tz <- z[2L:d]   sum(100 * (hz^2 - tz)^2 + (hz - 1)^2) } f_rastrigin <- function (x) {   sum(x * x - 10 * cos(2 * pi * x) + 10) }  ## We generate 20 instances (in this case, weights): weights <- rnorm(20, mean = 0.9, sd = 0.02)  ## On this set of instances, we are interested in optimizing two ## parameters of the SANN algorithm: tmax and temp.

Default: 1.    --test-iteration-elites  Enable/disable testing the elite configurations                          found at each iteration. Default: 0.    --test-type           Statistical test used for elimination. The default                          value selects `t-test` if `capping` is enabled or                          `F-test`, otherwise. Valid values are: F-test                          (Friedman test), t-test (pairwise t-tests with no                          correction), t-test-bonferroni (t-test with                          Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons),                          t-test-holm (t-test with Holm's correction for                          multiple comparisons).    --first-test          Number of instances evaluated before the first                          elimination test. It must be a multiple of `eachTest`.                          Default: 5.    --block-size          Number of training instances, that make up a 'block'                          in `trainInstancesFile`. Elimination of configurations                          will only be performed after evaluating a complete                          block and never in the middle of a block. Each block                          typically contains one instance from each instance                          class (type or family) and the block size is the                          number of classes. The value of `blockSize` will                          multiply `firstTest`, `eachTest` and                          `elitistNewInstances`.

Default: 1.    --target-runner       Executable called for each configuration that executes                          the target algorithm to be tuned. See the templates                          and examples provided. Default: ./target-runner.    --target-runner-launcher  Executable that will be used to launch the target                          runner, when `targetRunner` cannot be executed                          directly (e.g., a Python script in Windows).    --target-cmdline      Command-line arguments provided to `targetRunner` (or                          `targetRunnerLauncher` if defined). The substrings                          `\\{configurationID\\}`, `\\{instanceID\\}`, `\\{seed\\}`,                          `\\{instance\\}`, and `\\{bound\\}` will be replaced by                          their corresponding values. The substring                          `\\{targetRunnerArgs\\}` will be replaced by the                          concatenation of the switch and value of all active                          parameters of the particular configuration being                          evaluated.  The substring `\\{targetRunner\\}`, if                          present, will be replaced by the value of                          `targetRunner` (useful when using                          `targetRunnerLauncher`). Default: {configurationID}                          {instanceID} {seed} {instance} {bound}                          {targetRunnerArgs}.    --target-runner-retries  Number of times to retry a call to `targetRunner`                          if the call failed. Default: 0.    --target-runner-timeout  Timeout in seconds of any `targetRunner` call (only                          applies to `target-runner` executables not to R                          functions), ignored if 0. Default: 0.    --target-evaluator    Optional script or R function that provides a numeric                          value for each configuration. See                          templates/target-evaluator.tmpl    --deterministic       If the target algorithm is deterministic,                          configurations will be evaluated only once per                          instance. Default: 0.    --max-experiments     Maximum number of runs (invocations of `targetRunner`)                          that will be performed. It determines the maximum                          budget of experiments for the tuning. Default: 0.    --min-experiments     Minimum number of runs (invocations of `targetRunner`)                          that will be performed. It determines the minimum                          budget of experiments for the tuning. The actual                          budget depends on the number of parameters and                          `minNbSurvival`.    --max-time            Maximum total execution time for the executions of                          `targetRunner`. `targetRunner` must return two values:                          cost and time. This value and the one returned by                          `targetRunner` must use the same units (seconds,                          minutes, iterations, evaluations, ...). Default: 0.    --budget-estimation   Fraction (smaller than 1) of the budget used to                          estimate the mean computation time of a configuration.                          Only used when `maxTime` > 0 Default: 0.05.    --min-measurable-time  Minimum time unit that is still (significantly)                          measureable. Default: 0.01.    --parallel            Number of calls to `targetRunner` to execute in                          parallel. Values `0` or `1` mean no parallelization.                          Default: 0.    --load-balancing      Enable/disable load-balancing when executing                          experiments in parallel. Load-balancing makes better                          use of computing resources, but increases                          communication overhead. If this overhead is large,                          disabling load-balancing may be faster. Default: 1.    --mpi                 Enable/disable MPI. Use `Rmpi` to execute                          `targetRunner` in parallel (parameter `parallel` is                          the number of slaves). Default: 0.    --batchmode           Specify how irace waits for jobs to finish when                          `targetRunner` submits jobs to a batch cluster: sge,                          pbs, torque, slurm or htcondor. `targetRunner` must                          submit jobs to the cluster using, for example, `qsub`.                          Default: 0. -q,--quiet               Reduce the output generated by irace to a minimum.                          Default: 0.    --debug-level         Debug level of the output of `irace`. Set this to 0 to                          silence all debug messages. Higher values (1, 2 or 3)                          provide more verbose debug messages. Default: 0.    --seed                Seed of the random number generator (by default,                          generate a random seed).    --soft-restart        Enable/disable the soft restart strategy that avoids                          premature convergence of the probabilistic model.                          Default: 1.    --soft-restart-threshold  Soft restart threshold value for numerical                          parameters. Default: 1e-04. -e,--elitist             Enable/disable elitist irace. Default: 1.    --elitist-new-instances  Number of instances added to the execution list                          before previous instances in elitist irace. Default:                          1.    --elitist-limit       In elitist irace, maximum number per race of                          elimination tests that do not eliminate a                          configuration. Use 0 for no limit. Default: 2.    --capping             Enable the use of adaptive capping, a technique                          designed for minimizing the computation time of                          configurations. Capping is enabled by default if                          `elitist` is active, `maxTime > 0` and `boundMax > 0`.    --capping-after-first-test  If set to 1, elimination due to capping only                          happens after `firstTest` instances are seen. Default:                          0.    --capping-type        Measure used to obtain the execution bound from the                          performance of the elite configurations: median, mean,                          worst, best. Default: median.    --bound-type          Method to calculate the mean performance of elite                          configurations: candidate or instance. Default:                          candidate.    --bound-max           Maximum execution bound for `targetRunner`. It must be                          specified when capping is enabled. Default: 0.    --bound-digits        Precision used for calculating the execution time. It                          must be specified when capping is enabled. Default: 0.    --bound-par           Penalization multiplication constant (PARX) for timed                          out executions (executions that reach `boundMax`                          execution time). Default: 1.    --bound-as-timeout    Replace the configuration cost of bounded executions                          with `boundMax`. Default: 1.    --postselection       Perform a postselection race after the execution of                          irace to consume all remaining budget. Value 0                          disables the postselection race. Default: 1.    --aclib               Enable/disable AClib mode. This option enables                          compatibility with GenericWrapper4AC as targetRunner                          script. Default: 0.    --iterations          Maximum number of iterations. Default: 0.    --experiments-per-iteration  Number of runs of the target algorithm per                          iteration. Default: 0.    --min-survival        Minimum number of configurations needed to continue                          the execution of each race (iteration). Default: 0.    --num-configurations  Number of configurations to be sampled and evaluated                          at each iteration. Default: 0.    --mu                  Parameter used to define the number of configurations                          sampled and evaluated at each iteration. Default: 5.    --confidence          Confidence level for the elimination test. Default:                          0.95."},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://mlopez-ibanez.github.io/irace/reference/irace_cmdline.html","id":"author","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Author","title":"Launch irace with command-line options. — irace_cmdline","text":"Manuel López-Ibáñez Jérémie Dubois-Lacoste","code":""},{"path":"https://mlopez-ibanez.github.io/irace/reference/irace_cmdline.html","id":"ref-examples","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Examples","title":"Launch irace with command-line options. — irace_cmdline","text":"","code":"irace_cmdline(\"--version\") #> #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #> # irace: An implementation in R of (Elitist) Iterated Racing #> # Version: 4.4.0.dc51faf-dirty #> # Copyright (C) 2010-2025 #> # Manuel Lopez-Ibanez     <manuel.lopez-ibanez@manchester.ac.uk> #> # Jeremie Dubois-Lacoste #> # Leslie Perez Caceres    <leslie.perez.caceres@ulb.ac.be> #> # #> # This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain #> # conditions.
