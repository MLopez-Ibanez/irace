1.07

 * The best configurations found, either at the end or at each iteration of an
   irace run, can now be applied to a set of test instances different from the
   training instances. See options testInstanceDir, testInstanceFile,
   testNbElites, and testIterationElites. (Leslie Perez, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The R interfaces of hookRun, hookEvaluate and hookRunParallel have changed.
   See help(hook.run.default) and help(hook.evaluate.default) for examples of
   the new interfaces.

 * Reduce memory use for very large values of maxExperiments.  
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Federico Caselli for identifying the issue)

 * New option --load-balancing (loadBalancing) for disabling load-balancing
   when executing jobs in parallel. Load-balancing makes better use of
   computing resources, but increases communication overhead. If this overhead
   is large, disabling load-balancing may be faster.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Federico Caselli for identifying the issue)

 * The option --parallel in Windows now uses load-balancing by default.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The wall-clock time after finishing each task is printed in the output.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Federico Caselli for providing an initial
   patch)



1.06

 * Fix bug that could introduce spurious whitespace when printing the
   final configurations. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Fix bug if there are more initial candidates than needed for the
   first race. (Leslie Perez, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * New configuration options, mainly for R users:
                    
   - hookRunParallel: Optional R function to provide custom
     parallelization of hook.run.

   - hookRunData: Optional data passed to hookRun. This is ignored by
     the default hookRun function, but it may be used by custom hookRun R
     functions to pass persistent data around.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

1.05

 * New option --version. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Terminate early if there is no sufficient budget to run irace with
   the given settings. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The option --parallel (without --mpi) now works under Windows.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Pablo Valledor Pellicer for testing
   it)

 * Improved error handling when running under Rmpi. Now irace will
   terminate as soon as the master node detects at least one failed
   slave node. This avoids irace reporting two times the same error.
   Also, irace will print all the unique errors returned by all slaves
   and not just the first one.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Forbidden configurations may be specified in terms of constraints
   on their values. Forbidden configurations will never be evaluated by irace. 
   See --forbidden-file and inst/templates/forbidden.tmpl.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * New option --recovery-file (recoveryFile) allows resuming a
   previous irace run. (Leslie Perez)

 * The confidence level for the elimination test is now
   configurable with parameter --confidence. (Leslie Perez)

 * Much more robust handling of relative/absolute paths. Improved support
   for Windows. (Leslie Perez, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Provide better error messages for incorrect parameter
   descriptions. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)
    Examples:

    x "" i (0, 0)       # lower and upper bounds are the same
    x "" r (1e-4, 5e-4) # given digits=2, ditto
    x "" i (-1, -2)     # lower bound must be smaller than upper bound
    x "" c ("a", "a")   # duplicated values
 
 * Print elapsed time for calls to hook-run if debugLevel >=1.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * examples/hook-run-python/hook-run: A multi-purpose hook-run written
   in Python. (Franco Mascia)

 * Parallel mode in an SGE cluster (--sge-cluster) is more
   robust. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

1.04

 * Replace obsolete package multicore by package parallel
   (requires R >= 2.14.0)

 * Use load-balancing (mc.preschedule = FALSE) in mclapply.

1.03

 * Use reg.finalizer to finish Rmpi properly without clobbering
   .Last().

 * Remove uses of deprecated as.real().

 * Nicer error handling in readParameters.

 * Add hypervolume (multi-objective) example.

 * Fix several bugs in the computation of similar candidates.

1.02

 * More concise output.

 * The parameters expName and expDescription are now useless and they
   were removed.

 * Faster computation of similar candidates (Jeremie Dubois-Lacoste
   and Leslie Perez).

 * Fix bug when saving instances in tunerResults$experiments.

 * irace.cmdline ("--help") does not try to quit R anymore.

1.01

 * Fix bug caused by file.exists (and possibly other functions)
   not handling directory names with a trailing backslash or slash on
   Windows.
 
 * Fix bug using per-instance parameters (Leslie Perez).

 * Fix bug when reading initial candidates from a file.
