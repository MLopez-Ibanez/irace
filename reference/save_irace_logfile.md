# Save the log generated by irace to a file (by default `irace.Rdata`).

This function may be useful if you are manually editing the log data
generated by a run of irace.

## Usage

``` r
save_irace_logfile(iraceResults, logfile)
```

## Arguments

- iraceResults:

  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)  
  Object created by irace and typically saved in the log file
  `irace.Rdata`.

- logfile:

  `character(1)`  
  Filename to save `iraceResults`. Usually, this is given by
  `scenario$logFile`. If `NULL` or `""`, no data is saved.
