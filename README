Requisites
-------------

 * R (http://www.r-project.org/).
   Versions that work: >= 2.9.2
   Versions that do not work: 2.4 and earlier.

 * The wrappers `irace` and `parallel-irace` require GNU Bash.


Installation
------------

Install the [irace][1] R package on your computer. There are two
methods:

1. Install within R (automatic download):

        $ R
        > install.packages("irace")

   select a mirror close to you, and test the installation with

        > library(irace)
        > CTRL+d

2. Manually [download the package from CRAN][2] and invoke at the
   command-line:

        $ R CMD INSTALL <package>

   where `<package>` is one of the three versions available: `.tar.gz`
   (Unix/BSD/GNU/Linux), `.tgz` (MacOS X), or `.zip` (Windows).


If the package fails to install because of insufficient permissions,
you need to force a *local installation* by doing:
   
    $ mkdir ~/R
    $ R CMD INSTALL --library=~/R irace.tar.gz
    $ export R_LIBS=~/R:${R_LIBS}


Once installed, test that it is working by doing:

    $ R
    > library(irace)
    > system.file(package="irace")
    [1] "~/R/irace"
    

The last command tells you the installation directory of `irace`. Save
that path to a variable, and add it to your `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`
or `.profile`:

    export IRACE_HOME=~/R/irace/ # Path given by system.file(package="irace")
    export PATH=${IRACE_HOME}/bin/:$PATH
    # export R_LIBS=~/R:${R_LIBS} # Only if local installation was forced


After adding this, you should be able to invoke `irace` as follows:

    $ ${IRACE_HOME}/bin/irace --help

Usage
-------

1. Create a directory for storing the configuration of the tuning

        $ mkdir ~/tuning
        $ cd ~/tuning
   
2. Copy the template and example files to the tuning directory

        $ cp $IRACE_HOME/templates/*.tmpl .
   
   where `$IRACE_HOME` is the path to the installation directory of
   `irace`. It can be obtained by doing:
   
        $ R
        > library(irace)
        > system.file(package="irace")
   

3. For each template in your tuning directory, remove the `.tmpl`
   suffix, and modify them following the instructions in each file. In
   particular,

 * `tune-main.tmpl` should be adjusted depending on your usage 
   (local, cluster, etc).  

 * The scripts `hook-run`, `hook-evaluate` and `tune-main` should be
   executable.

 * In `tune-conf`, uncomment and assign only the parameters for which
   you need a value different than the default one. 
  
   There are examples in `$IRACE_HOME/examples/`.

4. Put the instances in `~/tuning/Instances/`. In addition, you can
   create a file that specifies which instances from that directory
   should be run and which instance-specific parameters to use. See
   `tune-conf.tmpl` and `instances-list.tmpl` for examples. The command
   irace will not attempt to create the execution directory (execDir),
   so it must exist before calling irace. The default execDir is the
   current directory.

5. Calling the command:

        $ cd ~/tuning/ && $IRACE_HOME/bin/irace

   performs one run of Iterated Race. See the output of `irace --help`
   for additional configuration parameters. Command-line parameters
   override the configuration specified in the tune-conf file.


Many tunings in parallel
------------------------

For executing several repetitions of irace in parallel, call the
program 

    $ cd ~/tuning/ && $IRACE_HOME/bin/parallel-irace N

where N is the number of repetitions. By default, the execution
directory of each run of irace will be set to `./TUNE-dd`, where dd is a
number padded with zeroes. 

**Be careful**, `parallel-irace` will create these directories from
scratch, deleting them first if they already exist. 

Check the help of `parallel-irace` by running it without parameters.


Parallelize one tuning
------------------------

A single run of irace can be done much faster by executing the calls
to `hookRun` (the runs of the algorithm being tuned) in
parallel. There are three ways to parallelize a single run of irace.
  
1. Parallel processes: The option `--parallel N` will use the
   `parallel` package to launch *locally* up to N calls of `hookRun` in
   parallel.
  
2. MPI: The option `--mpi 1 --parallel N` will use the Rmpi package to
   launch N slaves + 1 master, in order to execute N calls of
   `hookRun` in parallel. The user is responsible to set up MPI
   correctly. 
   
   An example script for using MPI mode in an SGE cluster is given at
   `$IRACE_HOME/examples/mpi/`.

3. SGE cluster: This mode requires Grid Engine commands qsub and
   qstat. The comand qsub should return a message that contains the
   string: `Your job JOBID`. The command `qstat -j JOBID` returns
   nonzero if JOBID has finished, otherwise it should return zero.

   The option `--sge-cluster 1` will launch as many calls
   of `hookRun` as possible and use `qstat` to wait for cluster
   jobs. The user *must* call `qsub` from `hookRun` with the appropriate
   configuration for their cluster, otherwise `hookRun` will not submit
   jobs to the cluster. In this mode, irace must run in the submission
   node, and hence, qsub should not be used to invoke irace (either
   directly or through tune-main).  
   
   See the examples in `$IRACE_HOME/examples/cluster-mode/`.


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

###### Is it possible to configure a MATLAB algorithm with irace?  ######

Definitely. There are two main ways to achieve this:

1. Edit the hook-run script to call MATLAB in a non-interactive
   way. See the MATLAB documentation, or the following links:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1518072/suppress-start-message-of-matlab/
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4611195/how-to-call-matlab-from-command-line-and-print-to-stdout-before-exiting
   
   You would need to pass the parameter received by hook-run to your
   MATLAB script:
   http://www.mathworks.nl/support/solutions/en/data/1-1BS5S/?solution=1-1BS5S
   
2. Call MATLAB code directly from R using
   [R.matlab package](http://cran.r-project.org/package=R.matlab). This
   is a better option if you are experienced in R. Define hookRun as
   an R function instead of a path to a script. The function should
   call your MATLAB code with appropriate parameters.


###### My program may be buggy and run into an infinite loop. Is it
       possible to set a maximum timeout?  ######

We are not aware of any way to achieve this using R. However, in
GNU/Linux, it is easy to implement by using the `timeout` command in
`hook-run` when invoking your program.
