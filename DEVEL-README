Developing irace
----------------

* make build

  Build irace

* make install

  Build and install the package
  
* make cran

  Check that the build is acceptable by CRAN

* make check

  More thoroughly test the build

* make quick-install

  Do a minimal build and install that has as few requirements as
  possible. Designed for installing on machines that are not used for
  development, like IRIDIA's cluster.
  
  

CHECKING:
-----------

* ./check-reverse requires installing R package devtools, which
  requires Rcurl, which requires:

  $ sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev

* --as-cran messages of the type: 

  Undefined global functions or variables:
     median p.adjust pchisq qt read.table recover rexp rnorm runif t.test
     wilcox.test 

  can be fixed by running:

imports_for_undefined_globals <-
function(txt, lst, selective = TRUE)
{
    if(!missing(txt))
        lst <- scan(what = character(), text = txt, quiet = TRUE)
    nms <- lapply(lst, find)
    ind <- sapply(nms, length) > 0L
    imp <- split(lst[ind], substring(unlist(nms[ind]), 9L))
    if(selective) {
        sprintf("importFrom(%s)",
                vapply(Map(c, names(imp), imp),
                       function(e)
                           paste0("\"", e, "\"", collapse = ", "),
                       ""))
    } else {
        sprintf("import(\"%s\")", names(imp))
    }
} 
R> txt <- "median p.adjust pchisq qt read.table recover rexp rnorm runif t.test
     wilcox.test" 
R> writeLines(imports_for_undefined_globals(txt, selective = FALSE))

And adding the result to NAMESPACE. Namespaces newly imported from also need to
be listed in the Imports: field of DESCRIPTION.


RELEASE Process:
-----------------

1. svn up

2. make check # passes

3. make cran  # passes


4. make examples # Takes a few hours. Inspect the examples in the vignette.

5. make releasebuild # Inspect the output for strange files!

6. make winbuild # passes. Wait for the 2 emails and check logs!

7. Update NEWS (add version number on top)

8. make closeversion

9. Send package as a pre-release to:

   * The maintainers of the packages listed in "Reverse suggests" or "Reverse
     depend" at https://cran.r-project.org/package=irace so they can check we
     do not break their packages (this step would be automatic once
     ./check-reverse above works). 
   * Google group
   * IRIDIAns

11. If everything is OK, continue, otherwise fix and goto 1.

11. Use http://cran.r-project.org/submit.html to submit
   Read http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

12.a IF the package requires further changes:

  * Make the changes.

  * Repeat the whole RELEASE process above without bumping the version number.


12.b IF the package is released in CRAN:

  * Bump the version number in Makefile.

  * make build # To update DESCRIPTION and other files with the new version."

  * svn ci -m " * Bump development version to $NEW_VERSION

13. Announce the release in the Google group:

    https://groups.google.com/d/forum/irace-package
