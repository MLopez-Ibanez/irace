README file for developers
===========================

CHECKING:
========

* ./check-reverse requires installing R package devtools, which
  requires Rcurl, which requires:

  $ sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev

* --as-cran messages of the type: 

  Undefined global functions or variables:
     median p.adjust pchisq qt read.table recover rexp rnorm runif t.test
     wilcox.test 

  can be fixed by running:

imports_for_undefined_globals <-
function(txt, lst, selective = TRUE)
{
    if(!missing(txt))
        lst <- scan(what = character(), text = txt, quiet = TRUE)
    nms <- lapply(lst, find)
    ind <- sapply(nms, length) > 0L
    imp <- split(lst[ind], substring(unlist(nms[ind]), 9L))
    if(selective) {
        sprintf("importFrom(%s)",
                vapply(Map(c, names(imp), imp),
                       function(e)
                           paste0("\"", e, "\"", collapse = ", "),
                       ""))
    } else {
        sprintf("import(\"%s\")", names(imp))
    }
} 
R> txt <- "median p.adjust pchisq qt read.table recover rexp rnorm runif t.test
     wilcox.test" 
R> writeLines(imports_for_undefined_globals(txt, selective = FALSE))

And adding the result to NAMESPACE. Namespaces newly imported from also need to
be listed in the Imports: field of DESCRIPTION.


RELEASE Process:
===============

1. svn up

2. "make check" passes

3. "make cran" passes

4. make releasebuild # Inspect the output for strange files!

5. "make winbuild" passes. Wait for email and check logs!

6. Send package to the maintainers of the packages listed in
   "Reverse suggests" or "Reverse depend" at
   https://cran.r-project.org/package=irace so they can check we do not
   break their packages (this step would be automatic once ./check-reverse
   above works). If everything is OK, continue, otherwise fix and goto 1.

7. Update NEWS (add version number on top)

8. make closeversion

9. Use http://cran.r-project.org/submit.html to submit
   Read http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

10.a IF the package requires further changes:

  * Make the changes.

  * Repeat the whole RELEASE process above without bumping the version number.


10.b IF the package is released in CRAN:

  * Bump the version number in Makefile.

  * make build # To update DESCRIPTION and other files with the new version."

  * svn ci -m " * Bump development version to $NEW_VERSION

11. Announce the release in the Google group:

    https://groups.google.com/d/forum/irace-package
