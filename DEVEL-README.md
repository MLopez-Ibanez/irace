Developing irace
----------------

* make build

  Build irace

* make install

  Build and install the package

* make cran

  Check that the build is acceptable by CRAN

* make check

  More thoroughly test the build

* make quick-install

  Do a minimal build and install that has as few requirements as
  possible. Designed for installing on machines that are not used for
  development, like IRIDIA's cluster.



CHECKING:
---------

* --as-cran messages of the type:

  Undefined global functions or variables:
     median p.adjust pchisq qt read.table recover rexp rnorm runif t.test
     wilcox.test

  can be fixed by running:
```R
imports_for_undefined_globals <-
function(txt, lst, selective = TRUE)
{
    if(!missing(txt))
        lst <- scan(what = character(), text = txt, quiet = TRUE)
    nms <- lapply(lst, find)
    ind <- sapply(nms, length) > 0L
    imp <- split(lst[ind], substring(unlist(nms[ind]), 9L))
    if(selective) {
        sprintf("importFrom(%s)",
                vapply(Map(c, names(imp), imp),
                       function(e)
                           paste0("\"", e, "\"", collapse = ", "),
                       ""))
    } else {
        sprintf("import(\"%s\")", names(imp))
    }
}
```
```
R> txt <- "median p.adjust pchisq qt read.table recover rexp rnorm runif t.test
     wilcox.test"
R> writeLines(imports_for_undefined_globals(txt, selective = FALSE))
```
And adding the result to NAMESPACE. Namespaces newly imported from also need to
be listed in the Imports: field of DESCRIPTION.
